## Introduction

In this project, your goal is to develop a website to promote the United Nations Sustainability targets. Through this platform, individuals will have the opportunity to make personal pledges aimed at contributing to a more sustainable world. 

### What you will make

A simple website with two pages: 

+ The first page will display information about the Sustainability targets.
+ The second page will contain a form that will be used to capture a pledge. This page will also display pledges that have been made previously.

You will also create a database with a single table to store the pledges.

### Hardware

+ A computer or tablet capable of running Python 3
+ An internet connection

### Software

+ This project can be completed in a web browser using [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/)

This project uses Flask. Flask is a web application framework written in Python that allows you to develop web applications relatively easily. Python Anywhere is free to use (for a basic account) and provides you space to host your files on a web server with Flask pre-installed as well as access to various database servers, including a MySQL server (which you will use for this project).

A free account on PythonAnywhere will allow a student to run a single web application at a subdomain on the domain pythonanywhere.com. There are restrictions in terms of storage space, CPU, bandwidth and outbound Internet access from your apps. However, a free account should be adequate to host a student project. Python Anywhere also has a free education beta feature to support a classroom learning environment.
