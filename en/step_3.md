## Creating your website

In this step you will use Flask to create a simple website.

--- task ---

1. From the PythonAnywhere dashboard, click on the “Web” link near the top right, and you’ll be taken to a page where you can create your website.  Remember that free accounts can have just one website.
2. Click on the “Add a new web app” button. This will open a configuration wizard that allows you to set up your site. 

+ Accept the default (free) domain name
+ Select Flask as the web framework you want to use
+ Select the version of Python you wish to use. PythonAnywhere has various versions of Python installed, and each version has its associated version of Flask. This tutorial uses **Python 3.9**
+ If you are a new user, you can accept the default settings for the file path. This will be: 
*/home/username/mysite/flask_app.py*
If you have an existing account, set another path (instead of mysite) or any files you have may be overwritten.

3. Now PythonAnywhere will set up your website and the configuration page for the site will be displayed. You will find there is a lot of information and there are settings that can be changed.

**PETE I WANT TO PUT A BOXOUT HERE**

there is one really important thing on this page that you need to be aware of - the site is given an automatic expiry date in three months time.  If you are likely to need the site to persist for more than 3 months, you must periodically return to this page and extend the expiry date. It is worth getting into the habit of doing this every time you access your account.  

**END BOXOUT**

1. Once you’ve signed up, you’ll be taken to your dashboard and will be given the option of taking a brief tour. This does not take long and is worth doing so that you are introduced to the basic layout of the site. You do not need to do any of the advanced tours.
   
4. Return to the PythonAnywhere dashboard. You will be prompted to check your email and confirm your email address. This is essential if you are likely to forget (and need to reset) your password at any stage.
